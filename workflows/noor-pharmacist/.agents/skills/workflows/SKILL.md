# Workflows Documentation

This skill provides comprehensive documentation and guidance for the Mistral Workflows framework, which is designed for building durable, fault-tolerant workflows with orchestrated activities.

## About Workflows

Mistral Workflows is an orchestration control plane that accelerates the development and reliable execution of complex, AI-driven workflows. Built on Temporal for fault-tolerant workflow execution, it combines a user-friendly API with a rich Python framework optimized for Mistral's AI services.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into several categories:

### Getting Started

- **[Introduction](references/getting-started/introduction.mdx)**: Overview of Mistral Workflows and its core architecture
- **[Installation](references/getting-started/installation.mdx)**: Guide to installing and setting up the Workflows framework (CLI scaffolding, optional deps)
- **[Core Concepts](references/getting-started/core-concepts.mdx)**: Workflows, activities, workers, executions vs runs
- **[Python SDK](references/getting-started/python-sdk.mdx)**: Documentation for the Python SDK and WorkflowsClient
- **[Your First Workflow](references/getting-started/your-first-workflow.mdx)**: Step-by-step guide to creating your first workflow

### Guides

- **[Workflows](references/guides/workflows.mdx)**: Creating workflows, determinism enforcement (sandbox), input types, timeouts, signals/queries/updates, child workflows, continue-as-new
- **[Activities](references/guides/activities.mdx)**: Timeouts, retries, heartbeats, local activities, sticky sessions, nested activities

- **[Error Codes](references/guides/error-codes.mdx)**: API error codes WF_1000-WF_1600 with HTTP status, description, and resolution
- **[Signals, Queries, and Updates](references/guides/signals-queries-updates.mdx)**: Workflow communication patterns with input validation
- **[Scheduling](references/guides/scheduling.mdx)**: Cron expressions, ScheduleDefinition, SchedulePolicy, overlap handling
- **[Dependency Injection](references/guides/dependency-injection.mdx)**: FastAPI-style Depends() pattern
- **[Streaming](references/guides/streaming.mdx)**: Task API, token streaming, progress updates
- **[Streaming Consumption](references/guides/streaming-consumption.mdx)**: WorkflowsClient.stream_events(), NATS subjects, SSE API
- **[Concurrency](references/guides/concurrency.mdx)**: execute_activities_in_parallel() with List/Chain/Offset executors
- **[Rate Limiting](references/guides/rate-limiting.mdx)**: Distributed rate limiting across workers
- **[Handling Large Data](references/guides/handling-large-data.mdx)**: OffloadableField, blob storage (S3/Azure/GCS)
- **[Payload Encoding](references/guides/payload-encoding.mdx)**: Payload offloading, AES-GCM encryption, key rotation
- **[Observability](references/guides/observability.mdx)**: OpenTelemetry traces, trace sampling
- **[Durable Agents](references/guides/durable-agents.mdx)**: Agent, Runner, RemoteSession/LocalSession, MCP, multi-agent handoffs
- **[Conversational Workflows](references/guides/assist-workflows.mdx)**: InteractiveWorkflow, HITL, ChatInput/FormInput, Canvas editing, Rich UI components, Tool UI states
- **[Local Execution](references/guides/local-execution.mdx)**: No-infra dev mode with Pydantic model params

- **[Workflows Plugins](references/guides/workflows-plugins.mdx)**: Mistral AI plugin, Webhook plugin, Nuage plugin, custom plugins
- **[Deployment Patterns](references/guides/_deployment-patterns.mdx)**: Best practices for deploying workflows
- **[Migration v2 to v3](references/guides/migration-v2-to-v3.md)**: Breaking changes and upgrade steps from SDK v2 to v3

### Testing

- **[Testing Workflows](references/guides/testing.md)**: Integration testing with `create_test_worker`, hang prevention, sandbox pitfalls

**Quick-test script** — run any workflow in a local Temporal test environment with zero setup:
```bash
python .agents/skills/workflows/scripts/test_workflow.py <workflow_file> --input '{"key": "value"}' [--timeout 30]
```

**Timeout policy for testing:** Use aggressive (short) timeouts to keep the feedback loop tight. A hanging test wastes more time than a false timeout. Defaults:

| Context | Recommended timeout | When to increase |
|---|---|---|
| `--timeout` (quick-test script) | `15` seconds | Workflow makes multiple LLM calls or heavy I/O |
| `execution_timeout` (pytest) | `timedelta(seconds=10)` | Known long-running workflow |
| `asyncio.wait_for` (pytest) | `15` seconds | Should always be slightly above `execution_timeout` |

If a workflow is known to be long-running (e.g. multi-step agent, large data processing), increase timeouts proportionally — but start short and only raise them when you see legitimate timeout failures, not preemptively.

### Internal References

These are additional patterns and utilities not covered in the official docs:

- **[Execution IDs](references/execution_ids.md)**: Generate deterministic execution IDs for child workflows
- **[Pipeline Pattern](references/pipeline_pattern.md)**: Build multi-step workflows with declarative StepSpec definitions
- **[Progress Decorator](references/progress_decorator.md)**: Track workflow step progress with automatic event recording
- **[Workflow Testing](references/workflow_testing.md)**: Ensure workflow classes are properly registered in workers

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

1. **Build durable workflows**: Create long-running, fault-tolerant processes
2. **Orchestrate activities**: Coordinate multiple tasks and operations
3. **Handle background jobs**: Manage asynchronous processing and task queues
4. **Create multi-step pipelines**: Build complex workflows with multiple stages
5. **Schedule tasks**: Set up recurring or delayed execution of workflows
6. **Develop LLM agents**: Build durable AI agents with MCP tool support
7. **Build conversational workflows**: Create interactive workflows with HITL, forms, canvas, and rich UI
8. **Ensure fault tolerance**: Implement systems that can recover from failures automatically
9. **Stream events**: Real-time token streaming and progress updates via NATS
