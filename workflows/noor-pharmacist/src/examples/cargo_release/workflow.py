"""Cargo Release & Dangerous Goods Compliance workflow.

Demonstrates Mistral Workflows' key primitives through a realistic maritime
logistics use case: OCR extraction → cargo classification → dangerous-goods
sub-workflow → customs compliance → HITL review (when anomaly detected) →
release certificate generation.

Key SDK concepts shown:
  - InteractiveWorkflow + wait_for_input()  (AcceptDeclineConfirmation)
  - Child / sub-workflows via workflow.execute_workflow()
  - Activity retry policies and typed timeouts
  - Deterministic branching in workflow code
  - Structured LLM output via Pydantic models
