"""Activities for the Code Modernization workflow.

All I/O, file reads, subprocess calls, and LLM interactions live here — never
inside the workflow body. Workflow code must be deterministic (Temporal replays
it); activities are where side effects belong.

Activity design notes:
- Each @workflows.activity() function is independently retryable.
- start_to_close_timeout caps wall-clock time per attempt.
- modernize_file_llm has retry_policy_max_attempts=2 to handle transient
  LLM/network failures within a single attempt. The validate-and-retry loop
  (up to MAX_VALIDATION_ATTEMPTS) lives in sub_workflow.py, not here.
