"""Sub-workflow: ModernizeFileWorkflow — one per source file.

WHY SUB-WORKFLOWS INSTEAD OF ACTIVITIES?
Each file modernization involves multiple steps (read → LLM → validate) that
can fail independently and need isolated retry surfaces. If we put all three
steps in a single activity, a syntax-validation failure would require re-running
the file read AND the LLM call from scratch. Instead, each file is its own
workflow:

  Parent workflow
    ├── ModernizeFileWorkflow (file A)  ← own history, own retry budget
    ├── ModernizeFileWorkflow (file B)  ← independent — B's retries don't block A
    └── ModernizeFileWorkflow (file C)

This is the "Workflows of Workflows" pattern. Each child appears as a collapsed
node in AI Studio's timeline, clickable for its own step-by-step drilldown.

    """Child workflow that handles one file end-to-end.

    Steps:
    1. Re-read the file (idempotent, safe to replay).
    2. LLM modernization via mistralai_chat_parse with structured output.
    3. Syntax validation in a sandboxed subprocess.
    4. If validation fails, loop back to step 2 (up to MAX_VALIDATION_ATTEMPTS times).
    5. Return a FileModernizationResult.

    RETRY MECHANISM — HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS
    Temporal retries an activity when *that activity itself* raises. Once
    modernize_file_llm returns successfully, its retry budget is spent — a
    downstream SyntaxError from validate_python_syntax does not cause Temporal
    to re-run the LLM call automatically.

    Instead, the retry loop is explicit in this workflow body: we call
    modernize_file_llm → validate_python_syntax in a for-loop. On SyntaxError
    we continue to the next iteration (a fresh LLM call). This makes each
    attempt visible as a distinct event pair in the AI Studio timeline, which
    is a better demo than hidden automatic retries.

    modernize_file_llm still has retry_policy_max_attempts=2 on the activity
    decorator to handle transient LLM/network failures within a single attempt.
    That's a separate concern from the validate-and-retry loop here.

        The validation retry loop is explicit: up to MAX_VALIDATION_ATTEMPTS

        If validation passes, we break early. If it fails on every attempt,
        we record syntax_valid=False and let the parent aggregate the result.

        Infrastructure failures from validate_python_syntax (TimeoutExpired,
        missing binary, etc.) are NOT caught here — they propagate so real
        problems surface rather than being silently swallowed.
