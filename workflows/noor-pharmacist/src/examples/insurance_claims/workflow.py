"""Insurance Claims Triage workflow definition.

This workflow demonstrates five Mistral Workflows primitives on a realistic
insurance-industry use case:

  1. Parallel activities   — all claim photos are analysed concurrently via
                             ``execute_activities_in_parallel``, not sequentially.
  2. Retry policies        — the flaky vision activity retries up to 3×.
  3. Deterministic branch  — severity routing is a hard Python if/elif/else
                             (not an LLM call) so every decision is auditable.
  4. Structured output     — every LLM call returns a typed Pydantic model.
  5. Observability         — AI Studio shows each parallel photo task, the
                             retry timeline, and the branch taken.

Workflow input shape (single Pydantic model → top-level JSON keys):
  {
    "claim_id": "CLM-001",
    "claimant_name": "Jane Smith",
    "description": "...",
    "photos": ["file:///path/to/photo.txt", ...]
  }
