"""Sam's Linear Weekly Summary workflow — v3 SDK with InteractiveWorkflow HITL.

The workflow declares the **linear** connector via ``@uses_connectors``
for team/project/issue activities. Summary generation uses Mistral's
built-in async plugin activity (``mistralai_chat_complete``).

``on_behalf_of=True`` on ``@workflow.define`` propagates the executor's
identity so connector lookup resolves the correct stored Linear auth.
